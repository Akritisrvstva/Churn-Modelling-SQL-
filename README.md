# Churn Modelling using SQL
### Churn Modelling

### Overview
Welcome to the Churn Modelling using SQL repository! This project aims to perform churn analysis and modelling using SQL on a customer database. Churn modelling helps businesses predict customer churn or attrition, enabling them to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers. In this repository, you'll find SQL scripts and documentation on how to analyze customer data and build churn prediction models.

Features
Data Exploration: Use SQL queries to explore the customer database and understand the churn patterns.

Feature Engineering: Identify relevant features or attributes that can be used as inputs for the churn prediction model.

Model Training: Implement SQL queries to create and train a churn prediction model.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualization.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the Churn Modelling using SQL, you'll need the following:

Database Management System: Install and set up a database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Sample Customer Database: Set up or obtain a sample customer database with relevant information for churn modelling.

Data Setup
Set up the database: Create the necessary tables in your database to store customer data.

Import data: Load the sample customer data into the respective tables.

SQL Scripts
The repository includes the following SQL scripts:

01_data_exploration.sql: Use this script to explore the customer data and understand its structure.

02_feature_engineering.sql: Implement feature engineering techniques to prepare the data for churn modelling.

03_model_training.sql: Create and train a churn prediction model using SQL queries.

04_model_evaluation.sql: Evaluate the performance of the trained churn model.

Churn Modelling
Data Exploration
Execute the "01_data_exploration.sql" script to perform data exploration and gain insights into the customer database.

Feature Engineering
Run the "02_feature_engineering.sql" script to preprocess the data and engineer relevant features for the churn model.

Model Training
Use the "03_model_training.sql" script to build and train the churn prediction model using SQL.

Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance by executing the "04_model_evaluation.sql" script and analyzing the results.
